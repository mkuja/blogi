# Blog

This repository contains my personal blog project.

- `blog_posts` directory contains blog posts in markdown.
- `html` directory contains the actual blog website.
- `my_blog` directory contains some junk to generate the html blog-post and rss output.

The `my_blog`-directory's main script has gotten out of its pen, and is in repository
root with name `blog.py`. If you want to try it out, install [python](https://www.python.org/),
optionally make a virtual environment and install requirements.txt with
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.
